# Salesforce Embedded Survey Example

This app provides an easy way to demonstrate how to embed Salesforce Surveys in a third party website using an iFrame.

The app allows you to quickly spin up a web app with a fake background that would typically be a screengrab of the third party website where the customer wants to embed a survey. (inspired by Frank Caron's External Identity demo!)

The survey appears in a floating button on the bottom right corner of the screen that opens a modal that displays the survey when clicked. You can control the look and feel of the button, the button text and the height of the modal via config vars for the Heroku App.

A live example of the app can be seen @ https://ac-embedded-surveys.herokuapp.com/

# Prerequisites

- Salesforce Feedback Management License provisioned in your org
- An active survey to be displayed on the website
- A Heroku account
- A Connected app with a digital certificate & Private key if you want to generate unique invitations for a contact and track their responses

# Mobile Support

- This app can be demoed from Desktop, Tablets and Mobile Phones.
- Tested on iPad Pro (10.5 inch - best demoed in Landscapre orientation), iPhone XS and Samasung Galaxy S10(best demoed in Portrait for both).
- **NOTE** - Smartphone Demo - Please supply an image for the BG_FAKE_MOBILE config var if you are planning to demo from mobile phone. The app will automatically switch between images for desktop and mobile based on form factor.

# Tips for Hosting High Quality Background Images

- [Install the Go Full Page Screen Capture Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en)
- Use the tool to take full screen capture for laptop/desktop as well as in [mobile responsive view using Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/).
- Upload both the pictures to your Google Photos account (work or personal).
- Follow the instructions here to generate a URL for each Google Photo that can be used for the BG_FAKE and BG_FAKE_MOBILE config vars. Use only the value of the **src** atribute from the generated embed code. For example a generated code on the website could look like the following. 2Fz6Fn5zq_hh75oNLsyNqyGSHzPopHojN77Eu6GImw_3bb4JteONR_K8lnCY2nRbZQV9RD7ACVYvTHEEoW6oGt2GNkAVXzsGdHl1XI9JWwr9ojo3N7t5mYgqaux8lESdvi4mJTti4Ok=w2400?source=screenshot.guru"> <img src="**https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Fz6Fn5zq_hh75oNLsyNqyGSHzPopHojN77Eu6GImw_3bb4JteONR_K8lnCY2nRbZQV9RD7ACVYvTHEEoW6oGt2GNkAVXzsGdHl1XI9JWwr9ojo3N7t5mYgqaux8lESdvi4mJTti4Ok=w600-h315-p-k**" /> </a>

# FOLLOW THESE STEPS IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE INDIVIDUAL SURVEYS FOR CONTACTS

# Salesforce Connected App Set Up for Individual Surveys

When distributing surveys, you can use a generic survey link for external participants and not require authentication or you can generate an individual link for a survey that is associated with a contact record. The app supports both scenarios.

Survey Links generated for individual contacts typically involves the survey being distributed via email or the survey being delivered in a Salesforce experience where the custome is logged in. Given that this is a third party website, a survey link is generated dynamically via an API call to a custom apex service and dynamically supplied to the iframe.
